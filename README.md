Hi, I’m Rodrigo Freitas.
I’m currently learning Javascript, HTML and CSS. My first programming language was C++. But I wanted to learn Python and I've made it. But now, I'm interested in Web Development and I want to work on back-end, although I only know a little bit of Front-End.
I'm still a beginner developer, but I study every day to improve my skills.
